		<p>The Beagle is a breed of small hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound.</p>
		<p>The Beagle is a scent hound and was bred to hunt rabbits.  They are happy, medium sized dogs
		that are expert hunters, but also make great pets... as long as you have a fenced yard!  Beagles 
		love to roam and unfortunately
		can roam far away from home or right into traffic!  Once their nose takes control, the beagles are
		in their own little world and may not hear their owner call them or see a car coming at them.</p>
		<p>Because of their love of roaming, many beagles become lost.  There are lots of beagle rescues
		who take in lost beagles and find them loving homes.  If you're interested in a beagle, please 
		visit an online beagle rescue site.</p>
		<p>Here are just some beagle rescues:</p>
