		<h2> Reviews </h2>
			<p> The St. Augustine Lighthouse has an average 4.6 rating and people love it! </p>
			<ul>
				<li> Matt Sampers: This place is amazing! Tons of history here. You can go in this lighthouse actually go up to the top! Make sure you try and read all the stories and history, there is so much to soak in from this place! The entrance fee for the lighthouse also includes the living house. This whole place is one big museum.  Fun for all ages, a must for visiting St. Augustine! </li>
				<li> Jamie Beu: 219 scary steps, but the climb is worth the view. The keeper's house has great exhibits for kids and adults. And the tour guide did a great job of explaining maritime archeology. There is also a playground and a nature trail as well. </li>
				<li> Gail B: Awesome experience! We loved the platforms at strategic places up the stairs for rest and some lighthouse trivia!! Great facility! Don't miss it even if you have already been up a lighthouse. They're all different in their own way. </li>
